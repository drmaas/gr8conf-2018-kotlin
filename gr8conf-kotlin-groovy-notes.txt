Why Kotlin?

Goals of Language

* Have fun
* less code, more productivity
* write once, deploy across JVM, JS, native, IOS, android, etc.
* similar to scala, but less complicated, compiles faster, and supports fewer advanced features
* simple like groovy, but more powerful static typing than @CompileStatic - example?
* first class functions
* extension functions like c# extension functions
* properties compile to fields and getter/setter
* singletons/objects
* null pointers create compile errors, use ? like groovy for nullable values, nullable annotations are pain
* explicit mutable/immutable
* when is more flexible than java switch, less than pattern matching scala
* no checked exceptions to simplify how developers handle them
* data classes like @Canonical
* sealed classes allow compile to deduce full set of allowable implementation types
* delegation allows composition to be used instead of inheritance, and allows for creation of dsl languages (along with extension functions)
- minimize syntactic overhead, maximize structure, remove boilerplate
* covariance/contravariance - in/out
* higher order functions as parameters, return values, properties
* coroutines allow lightweight concurrency
- async/await similar to c# and others
* excellent java/groovy interop

Comparisons to Groovy:

1) Extension functions vs. extension modules
2) Nullability checks / no NPEs in Kotlin / var vs. val
3) data classes vs POGOs
4) constructors
5) String templates and quotes
6) functions
7) Control structures
8) Type inference
9) collection operators comparison and mutability
10) Testing - Spock vs. Junit5 with mockito-kotlin, spek and kotlintest similar capabilities but found harder to use
11) Kotlin has singleton object, groovy uses Java static methods
12) Kotlin provides delegation, lazy keywords, Groovy has AST transformations (Delegate, Lazy, etc) via annotations
13) performance - kotlin roughly equivalent to groovy with CompileStatic
14) Simple DSL example in each
15)

TODO
* Concurrency - Groovy has CompletableFuture, GPars, and other libraries, Kotlin has coroutines/actors/channels/async-await and CompletableFuture and other libraries tools

Other Topics
* multiplatform support - compile to JVM, js, native
* Kotlin has no checked exceptions - same as Groovy
* Interoperability with Java examples for Kotlin and Groovy
* Groovy runtime metaprogramming - closest in kotlin would be kotlin reflection
* Dependency injection - @Inject constructor notation
* method interceptors/aop requires classes/functions to be open. default is closed (final)
